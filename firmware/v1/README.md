Bluetooth GATT (Generic Attribute Profile)
- GATT is used exclusively after a connection has been established between the two devices
- Attribute is the generic term for any type of data exposed by the server
    - Attribute type (Universally Unique Identifier or UUID)
    - Attribute Handle
    - Attribute Permissions
- Services and characteristics are types of attributes that serve a specific purpose. Characteristics are the lowest level attribute within a database of attributes
- Service is a grouping of one or more attributes, some of which are characteristics
    - together related attributes that satisfy a specific functionality on the server
- Characteristic is always part of a service and it represents a piece of information/data that a server wants to expose to a client
    - contains other attributes that help define the value it holds:
        - Properties: represented by a number of bits and which defines how a characteristic value can be used. Some examples include: read, write, write without response, notify, indicate
        - Descriptors: used to contain related information about the characteristic Value. Some examples include: extended properties, user description, fields used for subscribing to notifications and indications, and a field that defines the presentation of the value such as the format and the unit of the value
- Profiles are concerned with defining the behavior of both the client and server when it comes to services, characteristics and even connections and security requirements
    - Definition of roles and the relationship between the GATT server and the client.
    - Required Services.
    - Service requirements.
    - How the required services and characteristics are used.
    - Details of connection establishment requirements including advertising and connection parameters.
    - Security considerations.

# Data & Data Access

https://www.novelbits.io/uuid-for-custom-services-and-characteristics/

Standard Profiles, Services, and Characteristics:

Make sure to implement the following mandatory service and its characteristic
// Generic Access Profile (GAP) service with UUID: 0x1800 (SIG-adopted service) set by chipsetâ€™s SDK
//    Name with UUID 0x2a00 and value: Bluegiga CR Demo.
//    Appearance with UUID 0x2a01 and value 0x4142
